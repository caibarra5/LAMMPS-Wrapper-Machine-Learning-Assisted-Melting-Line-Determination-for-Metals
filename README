This program wrapper rquires lammps, preferrably named lmp and ran with
4 processors.
The files in.* can be modified to run different potentials for different
metals.
The neural network is not perfect and is meant only to assist in computing the
P-V data points of the melting line to determine the melting line.
The Simon-Glatzel equation P = T_{ref} * ((P - P_{ref})/a0 + 1)^a1 can be used
to interpolate the data points using a software such as xmgrace.

Run 0_main.bash. Can change temperature range one file zy* and lattice
constants in file c0*.
