This program wrapper rquires lammps, preferrably named lmp and ran with
4 processors as can be seen in the main executable "0_main.bash"
The files in.* can be modified to run different potentials for different
metals.
The neural network is not perfect and is meant only to assist in computing the
P-V data points of the melting line to determine the melting line.
The Simon-Glatzel equation P = T_{ref} * ((P - P_{ref})/a0 + 1)^a1 can be used
to interpolate the data points using a software such as xmgrace.

Run 0_main_args2:lammps_exe-num_procss.bash with two arguments: the lammps executable and the number of processors, in that order.
Example:
./0_main_args2:lammps_exe-num_procss.bash lmp 4

One can change the temperature range on file zy* and lattice
constants in file c0*.
